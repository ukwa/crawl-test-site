The [EICAR Standard Anti-Virus Test File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file) is a standard test file for virus scanners. It is entirely harmless, but all compliant virus scanners should detect it and raise an appropriate alert.

To help test virus detection, a crawlable copy is included [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/eicar-virus/eicar.com.txt).
